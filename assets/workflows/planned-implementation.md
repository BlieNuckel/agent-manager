# Planned Implementation Workflow

Use this workflow when you understand the problem well but want a structured plan before implementation.

## When to Use

- Medium-sized features or changes
- When you want to review the approach before implementing
- Changes that touch multiple files
- When you want documented steps to follow

## Stages

1. **Planning** - Create a detailed implementation plan
2. **Implementation** - Execute the plan

## Tips

- Review the plan carefully before approving
- The implementation phase will follow the plan strictly
